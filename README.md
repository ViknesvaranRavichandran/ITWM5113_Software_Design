Software Design and Development

1.	Introduction

Java is a widely-used high-level programming language that was developed by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle) in the 1990s. One of Java's primary advantages is that it is platform-independent, which means it can be used on any platform or operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. Java is a popular choice for developing a variety of applications, including web applications, mobile apps, desktop applications, and games.
IntelliJ IDEA is a feature-rich Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed specifically for Java development. JetBrains, the developers of IntelliJ IDEA, have created a powerful tool that provides many useful features such as code analysis, code completion, debugging, and version control integration. IntelliJ IDEA also supports several other programming languages such as Kotlin, Python, and JavaScript. IntelliJ IDEA is available in both free and paid versions, with the paid version offering advanced features and capabilities.
The Animal Kingdom project is a simulation game that involves simulating different types of animals interacting with each other in a virtual world. The objective of the project is to design and implement a Java program that simulates the behavior of the animals and allows users to interact with them in different ways.
To accomplish this, the Animal Kingdom project requires creating a superclass called "Critter," which defines the basic behavior of all the animals in the simulation. Then, it is necessary to create five subclasses of "Critter," each representing a different type of animal: Bear, Tiger, White Tiger, Giant, and Ninja Cat. Each subclass has its specific behavior and characteristics.
The project also involves implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) for the simulation, which enables users to view the animals and interact with them using mouse clicks and keyboard events. The GUI should display the current state of the simulation and allow users to control the simulation speed and other parameters.
Overall, completing the Animal Kingdom project provides valuable experience in developing Java programs using object-oriented design principles and building interactive user interfaces. The project is an engaging way to apply the knowledge gained in Java programming and create a real-world simulation that involves different types of animals interacting with each other.
